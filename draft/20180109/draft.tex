人工智能的一个目标是人类不但通过编程使计算机完成任务，而且可以通过教学使计算机学会如何去完成任务。近年来，一些研究者的工作向着这一目标迈出了重要的一步。这些工作\cite{graves2014neural, joulin2015inferring, kaiser2015neural, kurach2015neural} 利用外部记忆模块增强神经网络的能力，使神经网络学习到算法，比如复制，排序等。

在训练的过程中，我们发现模型很难收敛，因此我们使用了课程学习来简化问题。课程学习的策略是：……

深度学习在许多任务中都已经取得了很好的效果，例如机器视觉\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}，语音识别\cite{amodei2016deep}，自然语言处理\cite{bahdanau2014neural}等。但仍有一些任务，一直没有取得关键性的效果。算法学习任务（）是其中比较有趣的一种。这个任务可以追溯到\cite{gold1967language, angluin1983inductive}, 但至今还远未取得较好的结果。
将深度学习应用该任务之后，已经有了显著的突破。有一些结构已经有能力学会简单的算法，比如排序，加法，乘法等。

\cite{vapnik2013nature}证明了只要训练数据和测试数据来自同一分布，并且训练数据的数量多余参数数量，那么最小化训练误差就能保证在模型在测试集上可以取得理想的效果。这个性质在实践中非常有用，并且已经在很多实际应用中被证明。

The phenomenon of generalization to inputs that are outside the training distribution is poorly understood. The space of problems for which such generalization is possible has not been identified, and a detailed understanding of the causes of such generalization are missing as well. Given that the test inputs do not come from the training data distribution, we do not yet have a formal reason to believe that such out-of-distribution generalization should succeed.

\section{相关工作}
算法学习这个任务最早可以追溯到1967年\cite{gold1967language, angluin1983inductive}。在漫长的研究过程中，该任务有了许多不同的名称，例如:合成程序(program synthesis)，程序归纳(program induction)或者自动编程(automatic programming)，但是其研究目的都是为了让计算机有理解程序甚至自动编写程序的能力。\cite{gulwani2010dimensions} 和\cite{kitzelmann2009inductive}两篇论文从多个角度描述了算法学习的研究现状。

近年来，有一些研究者将机器学习方法应用于算法学习任务，并在该任务上取得了一些成果。特别是\cite{graves2016hybrid}提出的神经网络图灵机模型。这是第一次明确提出外部记忆增强的神经网络模型。根据这篇文章的研究结果，神经网络图灵机能学习到复制，重复排序等简单算法。

为了解决神经网络图灵机不能并行和训练难度大等问题，\cite{kaiser2015neural}借鉴了Grid LSTM\cite{kalchbrenner2015grid}的思想，提出了一种高度并行的神经网络结构-神经网络GPU(Neural GPUs，N-GPUs)。该文章将神经网络GPU应用于算法学习任务，实验结果表明该模型能学到二进制加法和二进制乘法。

\cite{zaremba2015reinforcement}使用增强学习技术训练了一个离散外部记忆模块的神经网络图灵机模型\cite{zaremba2015reinforcement}。该模型用离散外部记忆替代神经网络图灵机的可微外部记忆模块，在使用增强学习训练该模型后，该模型能学到复制，重复复制等简单算法。

另一个对神经网络图灵机做出改进的模型是可微神经计算机(Differentiable Neural Computer, DNC)\cite{graves2016hybrid}。该模型可以看做是一类神经网络图灵机，因为它们是由同一个研究者设计的，有着相似的结构。DNC主要


这些研究的目的是根据算法的输入和输出数据生成算法的原代码。
